# MaxCoverageOfDronesGurobi
Computer Network Performance project 2019 / 2020 for Universita' La Sapienza di Roma

Given:
* a set of drones
* a set of targets
* a matrix of distances 
* the battery time of each drone 

computes the drone paths such that the coverage of the targets is maximal.

The project uses gurobi framework to compute `constraints` and `objectives`.
